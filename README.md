# Computer-Graphic-And-Visualization

Q. How do I approach designing software?

A. I approach by designing tables or graphs that show what the purpose of the app is. I learned that you do not need a lot of bubbles to showcase what you want to overcome in the app. So by keeping it simple, I am able to get the message across.

Q. What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

A. I was able to get the concept of colors and how to apply them to the triangles. Other then that, I had a hard time working on the projects. This is the hardest class I've had to date. But I know that if I continue to work on it, I will get better.

Q. What design process did you follow for your project work?

A. Since we're working with C++. I was really rusty with the projects. So the overall design process was to write the code and test often. Being able to test often helped me catch the errors. 

Q. How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

A. Every tactic that I used will work with my future work. The more and more that I work on opengl, the better I will be. This is not an easy program to use, but I am determined to master it. It will take time, but practice makes perfect.

Q. How do I approach developing programs?

A. Same way as designing, but I tend to ask more questions when it comes time to develop. I want to make sure that the code is actually going to do what is needed. So by writing code, line by line, I'm able to see what needs to be added to make the code work.

Q. What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

A. I used basic math skills when creating the 3D objects. When we first started, I struggled with the simple x, y platform. Once I figured out that I could make the points line up with the x, y axis, I was able to re-create the scenes.

Q. How did iteration factor into your development?

A. I'd have to say that I still need work on it. The overall process was very confusing to me. I think that I tend to overthink things and make it much harder then it has to be.

Q. How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

A. I don't feel like much has evolved. Since I have to re-take the course, I am hoping that I will actually understand it better. I will focus on getting help sooner so I can get any question that I might have answered before the work is due.

Q. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

A. My overall goal is to get a job with Microsoft or Amazon, so computer science will help me reach that goal. I was a 25B in the Army and really enjoyed working on Classified and Unclassified networks. Troubleshooting was a lot of fun. Now that I am working towards code development, I feel like I am going to be a value to any IT firm.

Q. How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

A. This class will help in every way. The key is to actually know what you are doing. Once I can figure out the work, then I feel like this will only make me a better developer. Coding is not easy, but if you put in the work, I will eventually get it. Working on Python, Java, C++, and Android Studio will help me gain the knowledge that I need to hit my goals.

Q. How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

A. The knowledge of creating 3D objects is something that not everyone can do. Take me for example, I still struggle with it and I'm in the class. So being able to gain that knowledge is huge. I'm sure many employers are out there looking for someone with Opengl experience. It's a great tool to have in your toolbelt.
